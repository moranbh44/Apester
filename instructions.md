Hi :)

### Instructions
You need to implement 3 paths to run this process:
csv_file - the all_video_advertisers.csv file
json_file - the rubicon.json file
local_agg_csv - the csv file that you want to save the aggregation data

You can run this process locally.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
